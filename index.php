                            Welcome to sengathitlavanh.com.  This site is a repository for the products of my fickle mind. I am exploring my ideas through various mediums, from pen and paper, to digital painting, to 3d modeling and every where in between. Through my designs I seek to develop a consistent design language. My current obsession is photoshop painting.

                            I am currently freelancing as a front end web developer and under mentorship of some wise sages. This site will allow for some experimentation of some visual design vocabularies.
