                                    Photography has become another outlet for my itchy curiousity and serves as a quick self serving gratification. The lens of the camera offers another filter in which to view the world. It has also presented an opportunity document my travels in the recent past and capture specific moments in time. I am not a photographer nor do I pretend to be but am simply pursuing it as a distraction from the daily rituals. Enjoy!

                                    Photography has become another outlet for my itchy curiousity and serves as a quick self serving gratification. The lens of the camera offers another filter in which to view the world. It has also presented an opportunity document my travels in the recent past and capture specific moments in time. I am not a photographer nor do I pretend to be but am simply pursuing it as a distraction from the daily rituals. Enjoy!
